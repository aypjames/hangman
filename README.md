# hangman
Hangman game played using the console built using Java


# Project: Hangman

## MVP

-   Recreate a version of the game Hangman to be played in a Java console application.
-   The game should randomly select a word from the provided list
-   When the word is selected, a row of underscores representing letters in the word should be printed to the console, for example:

```
_ _ _ _ _
```

for "hello"

-   the user should be asked to enter a letter
-   if the letter entered by the user is in the word, the letter should be revealed, for example

```
H _ _ _ _
```

when the user enters "H"

-   if the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman should be printed to the console, for example:

```
___|___
```

after the first wrong letter is entered,

```
   |
   |
   |
   |
   |
   |
   |
___|___
```

after the second incorrect letter is entered,

```
____________
   |
   |
   |
   |
   |
   |
   |
___|___
```

after the third incorrect letter is entered.

-   the user should be able to guess wrong 7 times before they loose
-   they should be given the option to guess a letter or the whole word

## Bonuses

-   Read the word list directly from the file when the application starts
-   Create a history file that keeps track of user wins/losses and how many letters they guessed it in
-   Give user the option to verse the computer - the computer should select a letter, if the letter selected is in the word, it should be revealed, just like with user guesses. The computer should also try to guess the whole word.
